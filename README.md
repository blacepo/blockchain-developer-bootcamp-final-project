My project idea is a bit lighthearted. I would like to make a HODL dapp which is exactly what it sounds like.

Holding is hard. Especially when the market is so volatile and fud is everywhere.
My HODL app will take any ERC20 token and hold it in a time locked contract for X amount of time.
Think ETH will be 20k but have baby paper hands? HODL is for you. Put your money where your time is.

I’d also be interested in adding a feature that mints an NFT for you on unlock day that somehow represents time held and what token, but I’m not sure what the difficulty of that would be.

Something like the coin you get from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
Hi my names Alex I’ve been holding a shit coin for 2 years.
